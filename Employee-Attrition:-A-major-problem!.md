Employee Attrition: A Major Problem

Bill Gates was once quoted as saying,
“You take away our top 20 employees and we [Microsoft] become a mediocre company”.
His statement cuts to the core of a major problem: employee attrition. An organization is only as good as its employees, and these people are the true source of its competitive advantage.Organizations face huge costs resulting from employee turnover. Some costs are tangible such as training expenses and the time it takes from when an employee starts to when they become a productive member. However, the most important costs are intangible.
